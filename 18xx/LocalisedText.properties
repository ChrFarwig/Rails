# Conventions:
#
# For messages that include a dynamically generated component,
# The text strings are designated by number to denote their 
# position in the string to help aid translation of a complete sentence.
#
# example: System.out.println("This " + foo + " does not work.");
# is localized as:
#          FooString1=This    
#          FooString2= does not work.
#
# Note the initial space in FooString2, this is important to preserve. 
# Trailing space has been accounted for in the application.
#
# The exception to this convention is when single words are frequently used
# in one part of several strings. "Component" is one example of this, where 
# multiple error messages say "Component" + foo + "does something".
#
# When possible, related strings have been grouped together.
#
#### Added by EV 16jul2006:
# I prefer to use MessageFormat for this purpose.
# See the example at line 121.
