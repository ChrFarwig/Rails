		<!-- GAME OPTIONS must have:
			- a name, which must also exist as an entry in LocalText.properties,
			- optionally 'type="toggle"', which has the effect that the
			  selection uses a checkbox instead of a dropdown list.
			  In this case, 'values' must be absent 
			  (the allowed values are fixed to "yes,no").
			- optionally, 'values="a,b,c"' i,e, a list of allowed values.
			- optionally, a default value (only affects a toggle;
			  in a dropdown the first item is always the default).
