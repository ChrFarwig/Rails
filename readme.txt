This release fixes two bugs.

Contributors: Erik Vos, Stefan Frey

Bugs reported by Volker Schnell

Lists of bugs fixed:
- When buying trains from other companies, include companies that have floated 
but do not operate in the current round for any reason.
Example was the PR in 1835.
- 1889: the free tile lay of private C was not offered if the cash position was not exceeding
the (not-applicable) costs of building in the hex

Further:
- Sorted 1835 game options to make the Options list looks prettier.
