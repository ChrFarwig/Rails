Rails release 1.9.1

This is a minor release fixing the following bugs:
 
	- 1835 Fixing a bug which would cause the Prussian formation round to be neglected if no Minors would 
	be operating still at Start of Phase 5 while Privates would not have been exchanged.
	Bug reported by Oliver Heck.		 
			  

Thank you to all our testers. 

Please report any bugs you find on the mailinglist as usual. Unless theres a game breaking bug for which no workaround exists
 or can found, this will be the last release of the 1.9.-Branch. 
 


Thank you for the patience and feedback.
