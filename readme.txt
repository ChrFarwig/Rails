Rails release 1.8.1

This is a minor release fixing a number of minor glitches:

IPO shares of not started companies were highlighted as possible actions even though the player was
lacking the money to start a corporation. 
Fixing Tiles definitions and display tiles for 1880. Numerous
connections and positions were wrong. (8887 and 8888 for sure).
Fixed 2R train availability. (Michael)
Fixed updating problem with parSlots. (Michael)
Adjusting Gameslist.xml to reflect new status of 1880, moved the game
up in the list to the historical lineup.
Added Frederick Weld as Contributor to gameslist.xml
Added new pane to show par slots and last company to purchase a train. (Michael)
 
Please report any bugs you find on the mailinglist as usual.

Thank you for the patience and feedback.

Martin & Michael (together with the rest of the rails crew :))
