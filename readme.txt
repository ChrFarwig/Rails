Rails release 1.8.6

This is a minor release fixing the following bugs:

    - 1880: Tile definitions : Upgrade paths for small stations 
    		in green to brown was missing.
    		Investors who are closed remain due to technical reasons
    		on display until the end of the current OR. This caused
    		their homebasehexes to block new token lays, even if they
    		had been exchanged. This is now corrected.  
    	    

Thank you to all who reported the bugs.

Please report any bugs you find on the mailinglist as usual.

Thank you for the patience and feedback.

The Rails Crew wish you a Happy New Year 2014 !

Martin (together with the rest of the rails crew :))
