Rails release 1.9

This is a minor release fixing the following bugs:
 
	- 1880 : Fixed bug in placement of home bases for major companies
			 Fixed bug in handling of home base token on Beijing Hex
			 Fixed bug in starting a company with 40% share and investor and not receiving full cash
			 Added Log messages for the protocol regarding the Cash received upon a company reaching 50 percent.
			 Now the Expresstrains should be calculated correctly -> Thanks to Stefan Frey
			 
 Numerous Games got improved by additions from Frederick Weld.
			 
			  

Thank you to all our testers. ( The group at Winterburg for the Cash Problem, the Hamburg crew for the 
Express train and Game ending problem, and the BGG PbEM group for the Beijing tile upgrade and home base token problem).

Special thanks and an apology to Frederick Weld. His fixes got overlooked in the past.

Please report any bugs you find on the mailinglist as usual. Unless theres a game breaking bug for which no workaround exists
 or can found, this will be the last release of the 1.8.-Branch. 
 
 WORK WILL CONTINUE ON RAILS 2.0

Thank you for the patience and feedback.
