Many of the hex and hexmap related files were taken from Colossus ( http://colossus.sourceforge.net ).
Colossus is licensed under the GPL, therefore these files are GPL.

Many thanks goes to the Colossus team for providing a starting point for 
drawing Hex-based maps and also for creating a great version of Titan.
